# The Enhanced Session System (ES²)

The Enhanced Session System (ES²) is a system that allows for the creation of sessions that are more complex than the
standard session system. It is designed to allow mulitple users per session, have a more complex permission system, and
allow for more complex data to be stored in the session.

## Example

```ts
import { AdvancedScene } from '../sessions/scene.js'


```
